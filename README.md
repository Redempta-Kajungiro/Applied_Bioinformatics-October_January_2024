Title:Using comparative transcriptomics to understand the evolution of niche width and host use in beetles.

Abstract

In this project, we used RNA seq data to investigate gene expression patterns in four seed beetle species (CCM, CCC, CAA, AOO) subjected to four different food types: Natural host bean, Artificial pellets with natural host bean (control), Artificial pellets with natural host bean plus bergapten, and Artificial pellets with a mix of four host beans.
Using DESeq2 with a cutoff of padj < 0.05 and log2 fold change > 2, we successfully identified significant differentially expressed genes in the four species when comparing the control to the mixed bean treatment. The results revealed differential expression genes in AOO (147), CCM (382), and CAA (274), while CCC missed the mixed treatment. Moreover, our results revealed a significant difference in the number of DE genes relative to the total number of genes in each species. Specifically, AOO, CCC, CAA, and CCM showed ratios of genes with reads at 13%, 17%, 20% and 27%. respectively.
